But many babies continue to suck their thumbs to soothe themselves and engage in thumb sucking. It can become a habit in babies and young children who use it to comfort themselves when they feel hungry, afraid, restless, quiet, sleepy, or bored. So let us see what our development Expert Dr Clara Guru has to comment on it."

But any thumb sucking behvaiour post that age can cause significant developmental issues that are not just limited to physical or oral aspect but can extend to their cognitive growth too. If your baby is indulged in the thumb sucking behaviour after 2-4 years of age it is always best to identify triggers and help them correct the wrong behaviour patterns developed in form of thumb sucking."

They create new links and pathways between nerve cells, both inside their brain and between their brains and bodies, every day as they communicate with and learn about their environment. Although physical growth and improvement are easily observed and measured in precise terms, such as in inches and pounds, it is a little more difficult to assess cognitive change and development as clearly. Most of what experts know about mental and cognitive development is also based on the thorough study of developmental theorists and their theories, such as the cognitive development theory of Piaget and the psychosocial stages of Erickson. The ecological model of Bronfenbrenner also helps to some degree to understand infant mental development."

When babies participate in reflexive behaviours such as sucking when a bottle or breast is provided, or other reflexes covered earlier in this article, according to Piaget, they learn about their environment and how they can communicate with it. Babies don’t think reflexively about behaving; they instinctively carry out those reflexes."

                "content": "The second substage is primary circular reactions, which spans the ages of 1 to 4 months. During this time, babies intentionally repeat actions that please them and desired outcomes. In other words, they do things on purpose because it feels good or it gets them what they want. For example, a small infant may suck on her fist because it feels good to her and it soothes her. Researchers suggest babies of this age can also establish expectations about circumstances of cause and effect. After they witness the first event, babies will begin to see that a sequence of events is linked and begin to anticipate the second event. A baby of this age, for example, may learn that when they see a bottle, they expect to be fed soon. The assumptions of babies regarding the predictability of their environment form the basis of Erickson’s finding that young infants learn to either trust their environment or fear it. If a kid knows the pattern they need, such as hunger or discomfort, and the need is met regularly, they learn to expect to meet their needs and learn to trust. On the other hand, if babies learn a pattern of needs and those needs are not fulfilled regularly, they will learn to assume that their needs will not be met and they will learn to mistrust the world around them."

Having mood swings and feeling weepy is normal in these first weeks. This is called the “baby blues” (postpartum blues).

Interaction with parents is important during the first years of life to ensure sufficient psychosocial growth of children and the lack of stimulation is correlated with early social and cognitive disadvantages. The socioeconomic status of parents is a multidimensional construct based on several parameters, such as family income, material resources, education and jobs, as well as related characteristics of the community and family. The impact of socioeconomic status are well known on children’s cognitive growth. There is an elevated risk of decreased psychological well-being and emotional and cognitive growth for children who grow up in families with diminished socioeconomic status. Through several different mediators, such as prenatal influences, parental care, cognitive stimulation, diet, stress, toxins and drug exposure, socioeconomic status may influence neural growth."

How many of you, for instance, worry you’re going to go down the bathtub? None of you, luckily. But a child of three should really think about it while they’re sitting in front of the bathtub. A child will complain if he says something’s going to happen tomorrow, but he’s able to embrace the excuse that after we sleep, an occurrence is going to happen today. A young child may ask a question: How long are we going to stay? From this place to there? On the table when pointing to two dots.

All tasks that are part of cognitive development include the comprehension of size, time, distance, fact and fiction."
