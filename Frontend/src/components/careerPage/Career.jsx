          <h2>Our Journey</h2>
          <p>
            In 2015, three passionate individuals embarked on a mission to
            uplift children's lives. As they ran an education-focused NGO, they
            uncovered a shared concern – young minds with untapped potential,
            hindered by foundational gaps.
            <br />
            After conducting extensive meetings with more than 5,000 parents of
            infants aged 0-5 years, which included their own families, a shared
            aspiration became evident: to provide brightest possible future to
            the child. But they observed challenges arising from the rapid pace
            of the contemporary world, leading to a decline in access to natural
            socialization & outdoor experiences that were once readily
            available. Additionally, there was a notable absence of guidance to
            help unlock the untapped potential of the babies.So, in
            collaboration with esteemed experts, We developed a tailored
            solution aimed at promoting brain development & delivering
            essentials. The results were astounding.
            <br />
            In 2019, TEN-Toddlers was born, accessible to parents in over 150
            countries. We passionately believe that every child, regardless of
            their background, possesses boundless potential. We're here to guide
            you on a scientific and emotional journey to unlock it, by a
            customised program made for your baby.
            <br />
            <br />
            Join us on this captivating journey, where every child is truly
            special, and every family's dreams matter.
