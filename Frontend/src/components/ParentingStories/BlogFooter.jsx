      <h3>Our Journey</h3>
      <p>In 2015, three passionate individuals embarked on a mission to uplift children's lives. As they ran an education-focused NGO, they uncovered a shared concern â€“ young minds with untapped potential, hindered by foundational gaps.
        After conducting extensive meetings with more than 5,000 parents of babies aged 0-5, which included their own families, a shared aspiration became evident: to provide brightest possible future to the child. But they observed challenges arising from the rapid pace of the contemporary world, leading to a decline in access to natural socialization & outdoor experiences that were once readily available. Additionally, there was a notable absence of guidance to help unlock the untapped potential of the babies.So, in collaboration with esteemed experts, We developed a tailored solution aimed at promoting brain development & delivering essentials. The results were astounding.
        <br /><br />
        In 2019, UpTodd was born, accessible to parents in over 150 countries. We passionately believe that every child, regardless of their background, possesses boundless potential. We're here to guide you on a scientific and emotional journey to unlock it, by a customised program made for your baby.
        <br /><br />
        Join us on this captivating journey, where every child is truly special, and every family's dreams matter.</p>
